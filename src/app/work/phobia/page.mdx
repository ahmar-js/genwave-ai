## Overview

Traditional interview methods and simulation tools often fall short when it comes to assessing the nuanced capabilities of candidates. Recognizing the need for a more robust, intelligent solution, GenWaveAI partnered with [Client Name] to develop an advanced platform that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simulate real-world job interviews while also facilitating live candidate evaluations. This innovative system was designed to overcome the limitations of conventional condition-based assessment methods.
